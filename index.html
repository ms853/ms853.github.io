  <h3 id="aboutme"><u>About Me</u></h3>
  <p>My name is Michael Lehmann, and I am 20 years of age. 
  I am currently a student at the University of Leicester, studying computing with management. 
  I was born in Munich (Germany) and lived there until I reached the age of 11, then along with my parents, we moved to the United Kingdom. Now, you might be thinking that I became homesick living in England, which is true. Of course I miss my country! 
  To cope with this such feelings, I travel every summer to visit my relatives and friends in Germany.</p>

  <h3 id="beliefs">My Beliefs</h3>
  <p>I am a Christian, and as a Christian, meaning that I adhere to the teachings of Jesus Christ and his word (The Holy Bible). 
  I believe that mankind can recognise their purpose in life; adhere to their intuitive knowledge that there is a God who loves them, (St John 3:16).</p>
  <p>Here is a list of my favourite biblical quotations: </p>
  <ol>
	<li>Proverbs</li>
	</ol><ul>
	    <li>Ch14 vrs12: <q>There is a way which seemeth right unto a man but at the end they are the ways of death.</q>(KJV)</li>
	    <li>Ch2 vrs5: <q>Trust the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</q>(KJV)</li>
	    <li><q>The fear of the wicked, shall come upon him: but the desires of the righteous shall be granted.</q>(KJV)</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Romans</li>
	<ul> 
	    <li>Ch3 vrs23:<q>For all have sined and fall short of the Glory of God.</q>(KJV)</li>
	    <li>Ch6 vrs23:<q>For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eterinal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.</q></li>
	    <li>Ch3 vrs4:<q>Let God be true but every man a liar... as it is written.</q>(KJV)</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Isaiah</li>
	<ul>
	    <li>Ch54 vrs17:<q>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.</q></li>
	</ul>
	<li>Psalm</li>
	<ul>
	    <li><q>ch121 vrs7:The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy soul. </q></li>
	    <li><q>vrs8 The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even for evermore.</q></li>
	</ul>
	<li>Philippians</li>
	<ul>

	</ul>

	<h3 id="interests"><u>My Interests</u></h3>
	<p>What insired me to do a joint honours degree with computing, is that I was facinated by the great advances and rapid development of technology; its impact it has on our postmodern society. I sought this degree as an opportunity for me to engage in this technological movement.
      So far on my course, I have learned how to program in Java, HTML and how to use command line. I believe that with the skills I have aquired so far will enable me to progress in my studies; help me earn internship placements this coming summer.
      My ambition is to improve my technological skills - in that case master programming languages such as: HTML, Java, Javascript and PHP. I know that by mastering these programming languages I will be able to improve my technological skills and problem solving skills.</p>
